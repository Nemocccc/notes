- #### Monte Carlo

  - Probability approximation
  - definite integral approximation
  - Expectation approximation
  - stochastic gradient
    - Stochastic gradient allows for faster approximation of results

- #### markov decision process, MDP

  - agents interact with the environment
  - agents makes decisions and actions
  - environment act as rules in the interaction
  - state: all the information for one frame
  - state space: a set of state(limited or infinite countable)
  - action: agents' s decision base on current state
  - action space: a set of possible decisions
  - **reward**: value of the decision, defines by us.
  - **state transition**:
    - Deterministic state transfer is a special case of stochastic state transfer
